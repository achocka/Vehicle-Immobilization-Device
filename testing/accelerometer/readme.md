# Accelerometer data gathering

Using the ADXL345 breakout board and an Arduino programmed with the code in this section, our team performed a series of tests.

* `testing/accelerometer/data` contains all the data collected and MATLAB code to plot the data where spikes occured. 
* `testing/accelerometer/sensortest` contains code that utilizes ADXL345-Arduino library to interface with the accelerometer (make sure to include both .zips in this folder to the Arduino IDE)
